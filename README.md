# Phase 3 : Week-01 Code Challenge.

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the Python Coding Assessment, which evaluates fundamental Python concepts. The tasks cover basic data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming. Each task is designed to assess my understanding and application of these concepts in Python.

## Topics Covered
Basic Data Structures\
Functions\
Decorators\
Sequences\
Sets and Dictionaries\
Object-Oriented Programming

**Language :** _Python_

## Tasks

1. **Function: add_numbers (2 points)**\
***Description :*** Write a Python function named add_numbers that takes two parameters, num1 and num2, and returns their sum.

2. **Function: is_even (2 points)**\
***Description :***  Write a Python function named is_even that takes a single parameter number and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.

3. **Function: reverse_string (2 points)**\
***Description :***  Write a Python function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

4. **Function: count_vowels (2 points)**\
***Description :***  Write a Python function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.

5. **Function: calculate_factorial (2 points)**\
***Description :*** Write a Python function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number.

6. **Function: apply_decorator (1 point)**\
***Description :***  Write a Python function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

7. **Sequences: Sort List of Tuples (1 point)**\
***Description :***  Write a Python function named sort_by_age that sorts a list of tuples by age in ascending order. Each tuple contains a name and an age.

8. **Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries (1 point)**\
***Description :***  Write a Python function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are common keys, their values should be summed up.

9. **Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation (2 points)**\
***Description :*** Define a Python class named Car with the attributes: make, model, and year. Implement a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.
